# Resume Experiment
## Project Overview
I’ve been having trouble getting an interview for my first tech job. I’m a recent college graduate who has worked in the food industry throughout college. I never had an internship so the only tech experience I have is through college courses and personal projects. I have sent out over 200 applications in the past year and have only heard back from around 15-20% of the employers. I have never gotten an interview.

After researching about the job application process from a hiring manager's perspective I found out that employers use an algorithm to search for keywords in your resume that match the skills needed for the specific position. This is how employers are able to filter through the hundreds of resumes that are sent for each open position. 

This project is an experiment. I will create a second resume filled with the keywords/skills for the job I am looking for. I will apply to jobs with both of my resumes and see which one gets more hits.

## Project Statement
The information on my second resume will be the same and the second resume filled with keywords will be coherent. The only difference will be rewording the content on my resume to contain all of the most common skills that I know.

### What are keywords?
The keywords I keep referring to are skills that the employer is looking for in a candidate and the words that should appear on the resume.

### How to get keywords?
I will create multiple web scraper bots in Python to scrape job data from popular job posting platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, Google Jobs, etc. Usually in each job posting there is a section that specifies what skills the employer is looking for in a candidate. In this section I will extract the skills that are posted and put them into a csv file. After enough data has been collected I will do some data analysis to find which are the most common skills for the job I am looking for. These are the keywords that should be in my resume.

## Note
If I do not possess a skill, I will not put it on my resume. For example, it’s possible that Python and R would be a common skill that will come up in about every job posting for a Data Analyst. I know Python but not R so R will not appear on my resume. I want to add as many keywords as possible without lying.

Once I get a sense for what common skills are needed for a Data Analyst position, I will create the second resume and start applying to jobs.

## Metrics
